/**
 *    Somewhere near Redmond, Washington there is a rowboat that is used by
 * both Linux hackers and Microsoft employees (serfs) to cross a river. The ferry
 * can hold exactly four people; it won’t leave the shore with more or fewer. To
 * guarantee the safety of the passengers, it is not permissible to put one hacker
 * in the boat with three serfs, or to put one serf with three hackers. Any other
 * combination is safe.
 *    As each thread boards the boat it should invoke a function called board. You
 * must guarantee that all four threads from each boatload invoke board before
 * any of the threads from the next boatload do.
 *      After all four threads have invoked board, exactly one of them should call
 * a function named rowBoat, indicating that that thread will take the oars. It
 * doesn’t matter which thread calls the function, as long as one does.
 *      Don’t worry about the direction of travel. Assume we are only interested in
 * traffic going in one of the directions.
